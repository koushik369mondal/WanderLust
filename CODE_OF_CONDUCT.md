# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Code of Conduct is a shared promise to treat each other with respect, empathy, and fairness. We want every participant‚Äîwhether that individual is a newcomer or a long-time member‚Äîto feel safe, valued, and heard. This means welcoming diverse perspectives, communicating openly and kindly, and resolving conflicts constructively.

Discrimination, harassment, or harmful behaviour of any kind have no place here. Together, we can create a space where curiosity is encouraged, creativity flourishes, and collaboration feels natural. Let's make this a community we can all be proud of.

## Our Standards

- **Be collaborative**: Work together constructively and help others succeed
- **Focus on learning**: Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities
- **Give and receive feedback gracefully**: Provide constructive criticism and accept feedback positively
